# SimpleParser
Simple C# parser that uses the shunting yard algorithm to parse logic expression and compile to a delegate function. 
Has a small amount of Amazing Cultivation Simulator code dependency, because I made this for modding that game. However, the implementation and concept should be context free, and I'm uploading to just keep a copy.
